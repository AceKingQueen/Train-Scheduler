# Train-Tracker
This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data.

As the user enters train info into the form and submits using the button, the entered info is saved in a Firebase database and then sent back to display on the page. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a great tool for getting an app up and running quickly.

I also utilized [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) for the first time while building this app. I naively assumed writing code for working with time would be straightforward. It is not. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY) walks through this coding complexity and will convince you to explore tools like Moment.
